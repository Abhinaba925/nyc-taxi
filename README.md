This project tackles the NYC Taxi Trip Duration competition on Kaggle. It showcases a complete machine learning workflow, including in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced feature engineering, and the implementation of three powerful gradient boosting models: XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Finally, it combines these models into an ensemble to achieve superior predictive accuracy.

‚ú® Features
In-depth EDA: Visual analysis of trip durations, temporal patterns (rush hours, day of the week), and geographical distributions to inform feature creation.

Advanced Feature Engineering: Creation of high-impact features like Haversine distance to calculate trip length and extraction of time-based features from timestamps.

Multi-Model Implementation: Training and evaluation of XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost to compare their performance on a real-world dataset.

Ensemble Modeling: Combination of the individual model predictions into a single, more robust prediction using an averaging ensemble.

Git

Steps

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nyc-taxi-prediction.git
cd nyc-taxi-prediction
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

Bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm catboost matplotlib seaborn
Download the data:
Download train.csv and test.csv from the Kaggle competition page and place them in the root directory of the project.

üöÄ Usage
To run the full training, evaluation, and prediction pipeline, execute the main script from your terminal.

Bash
python train_model.py
This script will:

Load and process the training and testing data.

Perform feature engineering.

Train XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models.

Evaluate the models on a validation set and plot the performance comparison.

Generate a submission.csv file with predictions for the test set.
