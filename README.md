This project tackles the [NYC Taxi Trip Duration competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration). It showcases a complete machine learning workflow, including in-depth **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, advanced **feature engineering**, and the implementation of three powerful gradient boosting models: **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **CatBoost**. Finally, it combines these models into an **ensemble** to achieve superior predictive accuracy.

## ‚ú® Features

* **In-depth EDA:** Visual analysis of trip durations, temporal patterns (rush hours, day of the week), and geographical distributions to inform feature creation.
* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Creation of high-impact features like **Haversine distance** to calculate trip length and extraction of time-based features from timestamps.
* **Multi-Model Implementation:** Training and evaluation of XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost to compare their performance on a real-world dataset.
* **Ensemble Modeling:** Combination of the individual model predictions into a single, more robust prediction using an averaging ensemble.
